I am using the shorter data files (Alternate version) as I kept getting a MemoryError. 
Also I have used Python to implement this homework. 

Files and their purpose

unigrams.py : Used for extracting all the unigrams and their counts 
unigram_index.txt : Storing the results of unigrams.py, contains unigrams their documentID and count 
unigram_ouput : Screenshot of the output folder for unigrams.

bigrams.py : Used for extracting given bigrams their documentID and counts 
selected_bigram_index.txt : Storing the results of bigrams.py, contains bigrams their documentID and count 
bigram_ouput : Screenshot of the output folder for bigrams.
